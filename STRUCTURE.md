# Skills Directory Structure

This document describes the organization of the central skills repository.

It holds reusable skills used by both **Grok** and **Claude**. The skills ship
as Claude Code plugins.

```

Skills are grouped into **three plugins** (`golang`, `srd`, `craft`).
Each plugin is a directory with a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and a
`skills/` folder holding one directory per skill. Each skill directory has a
`SKILL.md` (the prompt) and a `README.md` (human usage guide).

---

## The Plugin Model

Both Claude and Grok consume the skills as plugins, not as loose skill folders:

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists the three plugins, each pointing at its
  group directory via `source` (e.g. `"./srd"`). Skills inside a group are
  discovered by the default `skills/` scan — the marketplace does not list them
  individually.
- Each group's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` names the plugin. That name becomes
  the skill namespace: `create` is invoked as `/srd:create`.
- Grok reads Claude marketplaces and plugins directly, so the same catalog serves
  both tools with no separate wiring.

Install and update commands are in [README.md](./README.md#install); the
edit-test dev loop (`--plugin-dir` + `/reload-plugins`) is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

---

## Cross-Skill References

Skills in the same plugin are copied together into the plugin cache, so they
reference each other with relative paths from their own directory:

- `review`, `edit`, and `system-check` read `../create/references/*`.
- `review` and `cover` read `../style/SKILL.md`.

Keep these skills within the same plugin so the `../sibling` paths resolve.

---

## system-check Memory

`system-check` keeps a curated platform-knowledge base. It is **user data,
not shipped content**, so it lives outside the repo at one fixed, `$HOME`-rooted,
per-machine path shared by Claude and Grok:

```
~/.agent-data/ctx42-skills/srd/memory.md
```

The `srd/` segment scopes it to the `srd` skills, so only they load it. The
`craft:enhance-skills` self-learning mechanism uses the same root:
`~/.agent-data/ctx42-skills/lessons/<plugin>/<skill>.md` for skills that run
from a read-only install. The repo ships only `memory.template.md`, used to seed
`memory.md` on a fresh machine; older installs migrate per
`srd/skills/system-check/references/memory-migration.md`. See each skill's
`SKILL.md` for the resolution rules.
