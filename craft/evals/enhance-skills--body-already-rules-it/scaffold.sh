# cm

Writes a git commit message for the staged change using Conventional
Commits with a Linux kernel-style body.

## Steps

1. Read the staged diff (`git diff --cached`).
2. Write the summary line, then the body.
3. Show the message; commit only when asked.

## Summary line

- Type: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `style`, `build`,
  `ci`, `chore`, `revert`
- Scope: optional, short noun
- Description: imperative, lowercase, no period, ideally ≤ 50 chars (hard 72)

## Body

- Wrap at 72 columns.
- Imperative mood.
- Explain why the change was made; the diff shows what.

## Output

Print the message in one fenced block and nothing else.

## Self-learning

Obey this skill's lessons when it has any: read both a sibling `LESSONS.md` and
`${AGENT_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.agent-data}/ctx42-skills/lessons/craft/cm.md`,
the sibling winning a conflict — a read-only install writes the second, and what
it learned there stays true once the checkout is writable again. Most runs have
none; absence is the normal case and needs no comment. On a correction or
self-caught mistake, append a one-line rule to the sibling when this directory
is writable, else to the fallback, creating it, and report where.
